# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category
2. Always add your resources to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to open an issue and a PR.
4. Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line, with capitalization consistent with the other entries in the section.
5. Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
6. âœ¨ Aaaaannd... don't forget to star the repo ;)

## Staking pools
BPs and Staking pools have the opportunity to showcase in the awesome list if the following conditions are true:
- The BP has a vaplid website available without errors or ssl certificate problems, and load in a reasonable amount of time.
- The BP is public (accepting public delegations).

## To remove an entry:

Open an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, and optionally create a PR.

Entries that have gone 404 do not require an issue to remove - just make a PR.
